vim-settings-dir
================

My shared .vim directory. 
This configuration includes all vim extensions and some basic .vimrc file used by me in all-day drupal development.

Installation
================
1. Clone this repository to your home directory as .vim directory
2. Initialize and update modules
3. Link .vimrc from repository to your local .vimrc file
4. Follow commandt module configuration procedure (you need to compile ruby extensions).
5. In this moment, you are ready to go :)
